# Abstract

This document is meant to describe how transactions of items and currency work within the ItemC network.

# Transaction Steps

1. Client A initiates a transaction.
2. Client A specifies type of transaction and Client B.
3. Client A signs the transaction with his public key and sends the transaction out to be verified by the network. The next steps here will vary depending on the type of transaction.

# Transaction Type

## Trade

A trade is a transaction in which two clients exchange valuables on the network. This could be two items, or an item for currency. Trades are different from sends in that they require two signitures
and are put into escrow until both signitures are received, or the transaction expires. This system ensures that there is no faul play during a transaction by removing the need for trust.
