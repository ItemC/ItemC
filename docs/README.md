# What is ItemC

ItemC is a system that utilizes Blockchain technology to create a better way to create and distribute digital items. ItemC makes it much better to verify ownership
of digital items, and trade those digital items without having to rely on a system of trust. The system is designed in a way to make trading of items for digital 
currency more secure. The risk that a person might not receive an item that he has payed for is greatly reduced. This makes ItemC a useful tool for trading
digital items that would normally require the trust of two or more individuals in order to work.


# Scenario

The following scenario will attempt to describe the idea of ItemC better and why it is a useful tool.

Suppose that Bill is a game developer developing a digital trading card game. He wants the game to have the same feel as a physical trading card game, which means
that there will be a finite number of cards and only specific people can have those cards at any given time. He could use a tranditional database to track ownership of cards,
but then only he can know that the cards that exist are legitimate and not duplicates. If he was evil he could also manipulate who owns the cards if they end up
having value once the game gets popular. Instead of using this traditional system, Bill uses ItemC. As a developer, he can use the ItemC API to create a project (his card game) 
and create items (cards) for his game that are available to anyone within the network, but itended for those people who play his game. He can trigger certain actions within
the game to transfer cards to the players. The players can be sure that the cards that they have are unique and belong to them by verifying it in the Blockchain. The
players trade these cards within the network for digital currency, part of ItemC.

Trading of cards is also made much more secure by using ItemC. William has a very rare card that he is looking to trade for some ItemC currency. He finds a buyer, Abe,
that is willing to buy the card for a nice price. They decide that they are going to trade, and Abe puts up the bid on the network and signs it with his private key
verifying that he was the one who initialized the bid. William now has a certain amount of time (specified by abe) to confirm the transaction and initiate the exchange
of items. William also signs the request and the transaction enters the network as a "mutually signed transaction" that needs confirmation. Once the confirmation happens
within the network William gets his payment, and Abe gets his card all without having to trust eachother or any third party. Since the value of the card and the value of the
currency could varry during the time that the transaction is waiting to be signed, there is a fixed amount of time that a trade transaction can exist on the network before
becoming invalid. This protects Abe from William deciding that he does not want to sell the card until ItemC currency becomes more valuable, because a trade request cannot
be revoked.
